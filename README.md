Data cleaning of an Upholstery company dataset. I was able to accomplish this by some series of steps which incudes; 
exploring the dataset to look through the dataset i am working with and the errors with it.
I changed the data types of certain columns into a more suitable data type for it.
I successfully removed duplicates from the set
I succeeded in spiltting the columns that needed to stand apart as seperate columns.
